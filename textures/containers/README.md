These textures are designed to go on a rectangular primitive to turn it into a shipping container. They were created as replacements for non GPL textures in UFO:AI and are simeltaneously released to the open game community.

There are two texture resolutions available, small, in which the shipping container is 128 pixels at the shorted point, and large where the container is 512 pizels on the smallest point. There are six colour variations in each pack, and one normal map for each texture type
